# ONVIF Server Progress

## Implemented & Working
1. âœ… Basic ONVIF protocol implementation
   - Device service endpoints
   - Media service endpoints
   - Stream URI generation

2. âœ… Configuration generation
   - Camera discovery and configuration extraction
   - YAML configuration file creation
   - Network setup script generation

3. âœ… Network interface handling
   - MAC address generation
   - Virtual interface creation (macvlan)
   - Static IP assignment

4. âœ… Multi-NVR support
   - Unique proxy port assignment
   - Combined configuration handling
   - Conflict avoidance mechanisms

5. âœ… Error handling
   - Added error handling for UDP socket errors
   - Improved robustness against Cloudflare blocking
   - Better logging for troubleshooting

## Fixed Issues
1. âœ… **EADDRINUSE Crash (WS-Discovery)**
   - Modified `main.js` to disable WS-Discovery entirely
   - Added error handling to UDP socket code

2. âœ… **WSDL Fetching Errors**
   - Vendored required WSDL/XSD files locally
   - Corrected schema locations to use relative paths
   - Added URI context option to SOAP services
   - Fixed file extensions for schemas

3. âœ… **Multi-NVR Proxy Port Conflicts**
   - Implemented dynamic port assignment in main.js
   - Added tracking of NVRs and assigned ports during runtime
   - Implemented port incrementation (RTSP +2, Snapshot +1) for each new NVR
   - Updated in-memory configuration with correct ports
   - Fixed EADDRINUSE errors when using multiple NVRs

4. âœ… **Static IP Assignment**
   - Modified network scripts to default to static IPs
   - Removed DHCP option from combined scripts
   - Improved interface naming for better identification

5. âœ… **MAC Address IP Lookup Failure**
   - Changed to calculating expected IPs based on camera index
   - Modified constructor to accept IP directly
   - Removed dependency on `os.networkInterfaces()`

## Fixed Issues (Recent)
1. âœ… **OnvifServer Reference Error**
   - Fixed class definition and export in `src/onvif-server.js`
   - Properly exported both class and factory function
   - Updated syntax and code structure to eliminate errors

2. âœ… **Network Interface IP Assignment**
   - Enhanced `setup-network-combined.sh` with IP verification
   - Added robust retry logic for interface creation
   - Implemented sequential creation with status checking
   - Fixed IP assignment issue for interface 192.168.6.48

## Working & Verified
1. âœ… **Server Startup** - FIXED!
   - Server now starts successfully with all interfaces
   - Properly assigns ports to different NVRs
   - All virtual interfaces created with correct IPs
   - No more EADDRNOTAVAIL errors

2. ðŸ”„ **Camera Adoption in UniFi Protect**
   - Ready for testing with both NVRs
   - All virtual interfaces are properly configured
   - Required manual addition using IP addresses

## Ready for Production
1. âœ… Fix the OnvifServer reference error - DONE!
2. âœ… Verify server startup with combined configuration - DONE!
3. âœ… Enhance network interface setup script - DONE!
4. âœ… Fix EADDRNOTAVAIL errors - DONE!
5. âœ… Create comprehensive documentation - DONE!
6. ðŸ”„ Test camera adoption in UniFi Protect - READY FOR TESTING
7. ðŸ”„ Consider creating a systemd service for auto-startup
8. ðŸ”„ Add more verbose logging options for troubleshooting

## Known Limitations
1. Requires root access for network interface creation
2. Network setup must be run after each system reboot
3. No automatic camera discovery mechanism
4. Limited to cameras with RTSP streaming capability

## Project Status: ONVIF Proxy GUI Application

This document outlines the current status of the ONVIF Proxy GUI application project, based on the plan detailed in `gui-implementation.md`.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   **Planning and Documentation:**
    *   Overall architecture defined and documented in `gui-implementation.md`.
    *   Technology choices (SQLite, Fastify, Tauri) documented in `gui-implementation.md`.
    *   Detailed implementation plan outlined in `gui-implementation.md`.
*   **Database:**
    *   Database schema designed and implemented in `db_schema.sql`.
*   **Backend - Initial Setup:**
    *   Basic structure for the backend API setup with Fastify in `backend/index.js`.

**Remaining Tasks:**

*   **Privileged Setup Script (`setup_interfaces.sh`):**
    *   Implement script to create MACVLAN interfaces.
    *   Implement script to populate the database with interface details.
    *   Implement persistence for network interfaces (systemd-networkd).
*   **GUI Application (Frontend):**
    *   Develop GUI using Tauri.
    *   Implement views and components as outlined in `gui-implementation.md` (NVR List, Add/Edit NVR, Virtual Camera List, etc.).
    *   Implement API calls to the backend.
    *   Implement snapshot viewer.
*   **Backend Application (Node.js):**
    *   Implement all API endpoints as defined in `gui-implementation.md`.
    *   Implement core logic for:
        *   NVR discovery and management.
        *   Virtual camera creation, configuration, and management.
        *   ONVIF server and TCP proxy management.
        *   IP address resolution.
        *   WS-Discovery client.
        *   Graceful shutdown.
    *   Implement password encryption for NVR credentials (bcrypt).
    *   Implement port management logic.
*   **Code Refactoring and Adaptation:**
    *   Refactor `src/config-builder.js` as per plan.
    *   Adapt `src/onvif-server.js` as per plan.
    *   Replace `main.js` with backend API server logic.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement robust error handling in the backend.
    *   Implement logging using `simple-node-logger`.
    *   Ensure meaningful error messages are returned to the GUI.
*   **Packaging and Deployment:**
    *   Package setup script as `.sh` file.
    *   Consider packaging backend as systemd service or Docker container.
    *   Package GUI application using Tauri for platform-specific installers.

**Next Steps:**

*   Focus on implementing the Privileged Setup Script (`setup_interfaces.sh`).
*   Continue developing the Backend API, starting with NVR management endpoints.

This project map will be updated as development progresses.
